<h1 id="day-1--from-almost-nowhere">DAY 1 : From almost nowhere</h1>
<p>I got a 1-year intense experience in Objective-C and iOS app programming.
Now I want to catch up programers who code in Swift.
Moreover, as I have never coded a game, it would be cool if I can do both : learn Swift and Game programming.</p>

<p>I found this page which seems very interesting :
http://kgoddard.net/tutorial/swift/xcode/spritekit/ios/2015/03/21/spritekit-swift-part-1-creating-game-scene.html</p>

<p>I spent one hour on this, and my impression was good : do it ! You will learn how to create a class, create constants, methods, and most of all, begin to understand SpriteKit. Nice tuto.</p>
